Some more specific recommandations are also yielded here. General guidelines The guidelines provided are here to homogenize the codebase of any application: every files, every lines, have to look like they were writen by one and only one person, regardless of the number of collaborators. Tabs/space length According to the knowledge we have at the time writing this text, there is no standard size for indentation. But one agreement emerged from all the sources we read: all the code must have and keep the same tab/space size. Expanded syntax It is better to use an expanded syntax in JavaScript: \u2705 Expanded \u274c Not expanded function myFunc () { console . log ( \"My function here\" ); return 3 ; } function myFunc () { console . log ( \"My function here\" ); return 3 ; } As both syntaxes have the same result, it is preffered to use the expanded one, for readability and understanding the code. Comments A one-line comment in JavaScript is represented by a double slash // followed by a single space and the content of the comment. For a better understanding and reading, a one-line commment must be on one separated line of the code it is commenting: A multi-line comment is represented by a block containing the content of the comment and surrounded by /* (comment opener) and */ (comment closer). For better reading, a multi-line comment must have its comment lines starting with an asterisk ( * ), which must also be aligned with the above (previous) one. The multi-line comment must and with the closing tag ( */ ) in a separated line of the last line of comment, and its asterisk must be aligned with the previous one as well. \u2705 // \u274c // \u2705 /* \u274c /* // This variabe does x... const myVar = 42 ; // My comment console . log ( \"Hello\" ); // And an other one document . location . href = \"https://github.com\" ; const myVar = 42 ; // This variabe does x... console . log ( \"Hello\" ); // My comment document . location . href = \"https://github.com\" ; // And an other one /* This variable does: * x, * y, * z... */ const myVar = 42 ; /* This variable does: x, * y, z... */ const myVar = 42 ; Variables Naming The naming convention in JavaScript for variables is lowerCamelCase, and using a self-explaining name is a must-do (but don't overdo it): // \u2705 Valid const myAnimal = \"dog\" ; // \u274c Invalid const a = \"cat\" ; // \u274c Invalid const MY_ANIMAL = \"bird\" ; // \u274c Invalid const theNameOfMyFavouriteAnimalInTheHouseIsTheFollowing = \"Oliver\" ; It is also preffered to name the variabes according to its purpose: Booleans Use one of the prefixes is , are or event has to explicit the boolean variable: let isValid = true ; let areCarsWorking = false ; let hasBeenHere = true ; Declaring To declare variables, the intended way is to use either the const or let keyword. Each one have its own usecase: const : declaring a constant. It's value is not meant to change. Scope: block. let : declaring a variable. Scope: block. // \u2705 Valid const myAnimal = \"dog\" ; // \u2705 Valid let myAnimal = \"hamster\" ; // \u274c Invalid var myAnimal = \"cat\" ; Why the var keyword is invalid? Well, it is not invalid, but the main purpose of not using it is its scope. var is function-scopped, while both const and let are block-scopped. In addition, var is writeable, so there is no warranty for constants defined with var , as per definition, are not read-only. Functions Classes Operations Strict comparisons To compare values of two variables, one must prefer to use strict comparison operations: const name1 = \"John\" ; const name2 = \"James\" ; // \u2705 Valid if ( name1 === name2 ) { return true ; } else if ( name1 !== name2 ) { return false ; } // \u274c Invalid if ( name1 == name2 ) { return true ; } else if ( name1 != name2 ) { return false ; } Boolean tests For boolean tests, it it preffered to use the shortcodes of expressions instead of explicit testing the values: // \u2705 Valid if ( myVar ) { doThings (); } else { doOtherThing (); } // \u274c Invalid if ( myVar === true ) { doThings (); } else { doOtherThing (); } Simplify if possible For commom operations, it is sometimes possible to simplify the code: \u274c Not optimized \u2705 Optimized function myTest ( myVar ) { if ( myVar === true ) { return true ; } else { return false ; } } function myTest ( myVar ) { return myVar ; // (1) } At this point, this function is not realistic, but you get the idea for optimization","title":"JSEPA-2: JavaScript coding style and guidelines"},{"location":"jsepas/jsepa-2/#jsepa-2-javascript-coding-style-and-guidelines","text":"","title":"JSEPA-2: JavaScript coding style and guidelines"},{"location":"jsepas/jsepa-2/#introduction","text":"This JSEPA aims to provide some general and simple guidelines for anyone.
