## JavaScript Enhancement Proposals Agreement, JSEPA

This projects aims to centralize the globally well-used coding conventions, and thus make this knowledge accessible to anyone.

!!! tip
    This project was mainly inspired by the famous [Python Enhancement Proposals, PEP](https://peps.python.org/pep-0000/).

## Introduction

The first use of the JSEPA is to provide well-defined, clear and functionnal coding style for the JavaScript scripting language. With time and patience, good practices and specifically JavaScript-aimed proposals will emerge by the community.
